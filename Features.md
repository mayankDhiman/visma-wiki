Currently, VisMa supports:

* **Simplify**. You can either choose to step by step perform each of the sub-function i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division or choose to simplify the whole expression/equation at once.
* **Find roots**: You can find roots for a quadratic equation.
* **Factorize**: You can find roots for a quadratic equation.
* **Solve**: This feature will allow you to derive the equation for a variable from a given equation. e.g. from x + y = 1, we can get x = 1 - y or y = 1 - x
* **Integration**: This feature will allow you to integrate an expression.
* **Differentiation**: This feature will allow you to differentiate an expression.
* **Graph**: This feature will allow you to get an interactive 2D or 3D graph, with equation of line or plane plotted on it, for better visualisation.

* VisMa allows you to use interaction mode, in which you can select a part of your expression/equation and run any of the functions above.
